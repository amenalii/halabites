# **HalaBites** - Halal Restaurant Tracker

## About the App
HalaBites is a web-based application designed to help users track and discover halal restaurants across Texas. Logged-in users can add halal restaurants they come across and want to remember, creating a personalized directory of dining options.

While Texas has a wide variety of halal restaurants, not all of them appear in a simple Google search. Oftentimes, people rely on social media posts to find new spots, but unless they visit immediately or save the name somewhere safe, they risk forgetting it.

HalaBites solves this problem by allowing users to save and organize halal restaurant listings in one convenient place, making them easily accessible whenever needed.
